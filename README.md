## Acknowledgements
The functionality of this library is inspired by the PHAzOR audio playback
module used in [Tauon](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks).

The name is based on the 
[Prismriver Sisters](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Prismriver_Sisters) from the
[Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project), who are a trio
of poltergeists who play wonderful music.
