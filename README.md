## Functionality

## Acknowledgements
The functionality of this library is inspired by the PHAzOR audio playback module used in [Tauon](https://tauonmusicbox.rocks).

The name is based on the [Prismriver Sisters](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Prismriver_Sisters) from the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Project), who are a trio of poltergeists who play wonderful music.
